## General information
***
From [SWAG's GitHub repo](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag):
```
SWAG - Secure Web Application Gateway (formerly known as letsencrypt, no relation to Let's Encryptâ„¢) sets up an Nginx webserver and reverse proxy with php support and a built-in certbot client that automates free SSL server certificate generation and renewal processes (Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL). It also contains fail2ban for intrusion prevention.
```

As SWAG is using the popular NGINX web server, is is highly flexible in proxying and serving, but it is more complicated to configure than [Traefik](../_traefik/README.md).

## Preparations
***
Create the Docker network _traefik_: ```sudo docker network create traefik```
  
Download the docker-compose file and create the *config* folder on your host.

## Setup
***
Get a domain name from [DuckDNS](https://duckdns.org).
Setup the DynDNS service in your router or on your server.

Do not forget to open the following ports:
- Outside port ```80``` to ```8080``` of your Docker host.
- Outside port ```443``` to ```8443``` of your Docker host.

Edit the docker-compose file's environment variables:
- `URL` to your DuckDNS domain.
- `DUCKDNSTOKEN` to your DuckDNS token.

Finally, run ```sudo docker-compose up -d```.

After SWAG has started the first time, open the *config/nginx* folder:
- Copy [mtls.conf](config/nginx/mtls.conf) to the root.
- Place the required files in the [mTLS](config/nginx/mTLS) folder.
- Copy [grafana.subdomain.conf] to *proxy-confs*.

For further proxying, have a look at the **.conf.sample* files in *proxy-confs*.
