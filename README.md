# Linux & openHAB: nice-to-haves, configuration and miscellaneous

## General Info

This repository is a collection of scripts and configuration files I use in connection with my smart home environment.

Folders starting with an underscore, e.g. [`_monitoring`](_monitoring) and [`_openhab`](_openhab) are feature folders.

Folders without an underscore, e.g. `etc` follow the Debian folder structure and represent my additions to the basic [openHABian](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/openhabian.html#openhabian-hassle-free-openhab-setup).

## NUT UPS

Setup guide for [NUT](https://networkupstools.org), the software to control your uninterruptable power source.

Please have a look at [this guide](/etc/nut/README.md).

## Various Scripts

The [opt](opt) folder contains a number of useful scrips.
